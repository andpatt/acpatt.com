# Changelog

## 2022-12-20 - Just starting out
------------------------------

This repo is for an entrypoint website into my professional identity.

This is so that I can better guide anyone looking towards the most relevant artefacts, rather than just a link to a gitlab group or my CV. 

Approach to creating this: 
- [x] do the TF for the DNS 
- [x] Get a very basic index.html
- [x] do the CI for the gitlab pages
- [ ] Draw out a picture of frontpage
- [ ] Start making a website
- [ ] Choose a palette
- [ ] Colour it in

So I tried out a few different wants of doing this. Starting with Numl, then trying semanticUI and then fell on PureCSS. 

Curiously, by being so simple, pureCSS showed me that I didn't need a whole big framework to do something servicable. I just needed a more structured approach to creating the HTMl!

The next step then is to structure some HTML that represents the page and then I think start theming it from scratch. with reference to purecss classes and similar websites.

I got somewhere. I installed hugo, found a nice looking theme and I've used that. It took maybe half a day to get a frontpage up. 

Now I'm just tidying up the repo for pushing.

- Moved repo to github. 
- Stupidly deleted the gitlab repo without moving the TF state so I'll need to re-init the TF and regenerate the secrets. 
- moved this changelog to changelog.md
- moved CI to https://gitlab.com/the-junkyard/acpatt-com-ci.
