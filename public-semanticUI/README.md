I had to install node, so here's how: 

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating - Go there and install nvm and then 
`nvm install node`.

I ran `npm init` and entered some metadatad for this package. 

Then `npm install semantic-ui --save` to install the framework, as per the infrsturctions here: https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html

(Actually, I first installed the ubuntu version of node, but that broke when I tried to install semanticUI so I'm trying to do the above now. )
