So i start this one as a sort of last ditch attempt. I tried next, realised that I didn't know enough React, asked Seb for help, he pointed me at awesome-css. I tried numl, but the abstractions were too broad and I couldn't figure out which class was causing what to happen. 

I tried semanticUI but couldn't even get the thing installed. 

Seb said to look at purecss and I have and I've got somewhere now. 

I'm pleased. 

As of [the previous commit](10e848c7c2b209642befe9117517add80a9a5a69) I've got the header and a basic hero text. 

What do I want next? 

I think do a "story" section: 

"The son of two care workers from Teesside and Scotland, I grew up with my sister Ruth in a hamlet on the edge of the North York Moors."


"I grew up with the outdoors, but also with music - both listened to and played - all throughout my youth. My parents gave us opportunities they never had."



-----------------
As of the commit of which this readme is a part, I decided to make the frontpage be pictures and links to each individual section.
