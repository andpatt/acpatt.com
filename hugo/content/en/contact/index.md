I always have LinkedIn notifications turned on so [send me a message](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-charles-patterson/).

Hit me up on [my work email](mailto:andrew@jumpingrivers.com) to talk about the work we do at [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/).

Otherwise, you can [email me](mailto:andrew@acpatt.com) about jobs or anything else and I'll try and get a response to you within a couple weeks.
