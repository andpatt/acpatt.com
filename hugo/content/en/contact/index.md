I always have notifications turned on on LinkedIn, so feel free to [send me a message](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-charles-patterson/).

Otherwise, you can [email me](mailto:andrew@acpatt.com) about personal stuff and I'll try and get a response to you within a couple weeks. 

If you want to have a chat with me about the work we do at [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/), then hit me up on [my work email](mailto:andrew@jumpingrivers.com).
