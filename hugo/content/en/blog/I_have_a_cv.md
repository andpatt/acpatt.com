## The Vision

I want to run a consulting firm some day.

I see myself probably being long-term successful in a fast-paced, varied role like being a self-employed consultant/trainer. With my passion for talking to and helping people, I'd like to manage people, meaning probably I want to operate a consultancy business. Not a sure bet, but maybe probable. 

To start a consultancy/training business (or to run an existing one) I need to be able to: 

- [**✓**] Do things that people will buy ( Technical Skills, Product/service Management)  
- [**~**] Convince people to buy those things (Sales & Marketing)  
- [**✓**] Manage and lead people
- [**✓**] Know how to manage work
- [**x**] Know how to run a business 
- [**x**] Understand business finances (Finance)  
- [**~**] Communication & Negotiation


## The Goal

As for how that affects me now, you need a closer scope. 

I've long held the view that, until I'm 30, I want to broaden my skills and experiences as much as possible. I don't want to specialise too hard, because once I do, the inertia will make it harder for me to respond quickly to a future work environment that is not going to hang around. 

So what am I doing about that? 

Well I'm currently speccing into learning more skills that people will buy. I'm already competent as a Networking & security professional, DevOps & cloud engineer, project manager and solutions architect. I'm also currently in the "data world" - delivering data solutions to clients. So a natural direction to broaden into is data engineering and then data science. 

So that's the goal. In 18 months, I want to have worked very hard and built a load of skills in data engineering, cleaning, manipulation, data pipelines, platforms etc. 

Okay, so how do I do that? Well with my current skillset I could fairly comfortably get a job as a Data engineer. But I'm currently an Infrastructure Lead, and I would like also to be able to manage people, to build team plans and execute on business strategy. 

So I'm pitching at a Senior Data Engineer/Team lead role. I know I can learn fast, I already have basis in the technical skills and I can bring a bunch of leadership experience. 

Now to build a CV to prove it.

## The Next Step

To know what to put in a CV, I first needed to know what employers want. So I trawled job search sites for maybe 50 jobs titled "senior data engineer" and pulled all the technical skills.

The list was 16 pages long, so I processed them. I deduplicated skills between job ads, noting the frequency of each skill, as well as whether it tended to be in the "must have" or "desirable". I sorted by frequency, and what I ended up with looked something like this:


| Skill | Frequency | Must Have |
|----------|--------------------|-----|
|  SQL  | 22 | Yes |
| Python basics | 17 | Yes |
| Pandas & NumPY (wrangling) | 12 | Yes |
| MPP & Columnar Databases | 10 | No |
| ... | ... | ... |
| Docker  | 9 | No |
| Kubernetes | 6 | No |
| ... | ... | ... |
| Hive/Kafka/Trino | 2 | No |
| Elasticsearch | 1 | No |


This gave me a prioritised list of the skills I should be able to evidence.

Pulling out the skills I already have gives me the best things to put in my CV, and pulling out the skills I don't have gives me a prioritised syllabus for upskilling as a data engineer!

So that's what I've done. I made a CV. I'm proud of it, and [it's here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k-cRV6AqpDD63euOaUNyH1mC_KxUdwvQrjBJwecAzhM/preview)
