It's been a while, Internet. This one's going to be a ramble, so.. don't say I didn't warn you.

The last time I had a website was when I first learnt about HTML and CSS - nearly five years ago now. It was a hell of a time, that. I'd not long had my first job as a server and network engineer, but I got a wholesale introduction to the entire world of IT, networks, small business, software development, devops. It was great.

Anyway, the website. It was awful! it was raw HTML and CSS for everything, and it wasn't a small website!

It had a lyrics page so I could remember the lyrics when I was playing along to [Ruth](https://www.ruthlyonmusic.com/)'s music, it had just nice pictures I liked? I think? It even had CI!

At the time I lived in a flat in east Yorkshire with my partner (now Fiance√©) Charlotte and life was.. pretty good. It still is, actually. 

The website was actually a small part of my tinkerings back then. I was learning about servers and networks and so I got some old decommissioned rack servers and built myself a little datacentre in my office. _**My god**_ they were loud though. Like, _quarter of a mile from an airport right under the flightpath_ loud. They were loud. 

But I had earplugs and I didn't like spending money so I installed proxmox and pfsense for hypervisor and firewall, freeNAS for storage, learned VLANs on a few switches. But I was also learning about domain controllers and end-user support at work, so I got a SAMBA4 based domain controller running and made myself some pretend users and a mailserver and all that fun stuff.

I was running enough infrastructure to support a medium sized business out of my (very small) office in my spare time. 

It's kinda tragic how many hours I spent back then because I didn't know that ansible existed.
