# __main__

This repo is for an entrypoint website into my professional identity.

This is so that I can better guide anyone looking towards the most relevant artefacts, rather than just a link to a gitlab group or my CV. 

Approach to creating this: 
- [x] do the TF for the DNS 
- [x] Get a very basic index.html
- [x] do the CI for the gitlab pages
- [ ] Draw out a picture of frontpage
- [ ] Start making a website
- [ ] Choose a palette
- [ ] Colour it in
