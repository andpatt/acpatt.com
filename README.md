# __main__

This repo is for an entrypoint website into my professional identity.

This is so that I can better guide anyone looking towards the most relevant artefacts, rather than just a link to a gitlab group or my CV. 

Approach to creating this: 
- do the TF for the DNS
- Get a very basic index.html
- do the CI for the gitlab pages
- Start making a website from scratch by hand
