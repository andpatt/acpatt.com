# ACPatt.com Repo

This is my website. 

### Big bits

The website is live at https://acpatt.com

This repo lives at https://github.com/andpatt/acpatt.com/ 

There is a copy of this repo at https://gitlab.com/the-junkyard/acpatt-com-ci to handle the CI for the website (publishing to gitlab pages.)

### folder layout

Currently the `hugo` dir contains the website. 

`archive` has old attempts at the website. `blog_data` and `design_ideas` are places to put ideas for blogs, changes to the website design and just thoughts.

`terraform` has the terraform folder.
